> **Note:** This project was built as a personal learning portfolio 4 years ago (2019-2020) and is no longer maintained. Some demos (e.g., Twitter analytics) are non-functional due to API changes. It remains here as a reference to my early work with JavaScript, Vue, and Nuxt.js.

## Project Overview
A personal portfolio and learning sandbox built with Nuxt.js. This site showcases early experiments in customer segmentation, sentiment analysis, and interactive data visualizations, serving as a sandbox for learning modern JavaScript frameworks and UI techniques. **Note:** The Twitter analytics demo is no longer functional due to Twitter API changes.

## Features
- Interactive portfolio and skills showcase
- Customer segmentation and sentiment analysis demos
- Data visualizations
- Modular Vue/Nuxt.js component structure

## Tech Stack

- Vue.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vuex (state management)
- SCSS/CSS3
- [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) (3D graphics)
- [amCharts 5](https://www.amcharts.com/) (data visualizations)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (animations, via nuxt-gsap-module)
